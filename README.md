Repository provides SageMath codes related to computing Egyptian fractions:

* `egypt_rep.sage` - computes/enumerates general Egyptian fractions, and those corresponding to the formal codegrees of integral fusion categories.
It accompanies the paper *"Classifying integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5 and beyond"* by Max A. Alekseyev, Winfried Bruns, Jingcheng Dong, Sebastien Palcoux
https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07023

* `rep_sq.sage` - computes/enumerates general Egyptian fractions with squared denominators, and those corresponding to the fusion ring types.
It accompanies the paper *"Classification of integral modular data up to rank 13"* by Max A. Alekseyev, Winfried Bruns, Sebastien Palcoux, Fedor V. Petrov
